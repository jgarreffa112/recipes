Arancini al Ragu,Italian,,"12 oz mozzarella,1 cup peas,8 oz water,  pepper to taste,  salt to taste,6 oz tomato paste,21 oz tomato puree,4 oz red wine,1  Italian sausage,10 oz ground beef,2 cloves garlic,1 stalks celery,1  carrot,1  onion(s)","**See for Risotto alla Milanese recipe.**

Prep:
Mince 1 large carrot, 1 stalk celery, and 1 onion. Remove the skin from the sausage if using it.

Directions:

FILLING
Sauté the carrot, celery, and onion with the lid on until the vegetables are soft, but NOT brown. Peel and crush the garlic and add it to the skillet along with 10.5 oz. ground beef and 7 oz. Italian sausage (or just 1 lb of ground beef, if making this halal).

Once the meat and vegetables are browned, add 4 oz. red wine and cook off the alcohol. Then, stir in salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste, 21 oz. tomato purée, and 6 oz. tomato paste. 

Add 1 cup of water and cook on low with the lid on for AT LEAST 1 hour. Stir every 20 minutes and check on the consistency. Add more water if needed. The filling needs to be thick enough to stuff the arancini without running.

At this point, make the risotto alla milanese (https://airtable.com/tbl92CJHbBm88k4tP/viw3hrVUGyE5Rv4Wi/recILl2QjVvLlq8Og).

ASSEMBLY & COOKING
Shape risotto into little cups. Place a small amount of filling in the hole. Wrap the sides up and around to close the ball. Careful not to overfill or make the risotto layer too thin, or the filling will ooze out. 

Next, roll each ball in flour, whisked egg, and breadcrumbs successively. 

If air frying, preheat the air fryer to 400 F and cook in batches for 10 minutes. Put only one layer of arancini in the basket!

If baking, preheat the oven to 425 F and cook on a baking sheet for 15-20 minutes.

If deep frying, heat oil in a pot until it's boiling. Dunk each ball in the oil for ~2 minutes or until the outside has crisped.

Serve arancini with marinara for dipping if desired.","Source:

1 roma tomato, diced***
1/2 cup white onion, diced
1/2 cup peas
1.5 tbsp olive oil
1 clove garlic
1 cups long-grain white rice, rinsed and drained
2 1/2 cups vegetable broth
1.5 tbsp tomato paste
salt, to taste
pepper to taste

Prep:
Let 1 cup rice soak while you dice 1/2 cup onion.

Dice 1 roma tomato and crush 1 clove garlic. Keep the onion separate from these. 

Rinse the rice until the water is clear, then mix in the onion.

Directions:
Sauté the rice and onions in some olive oil for ~6-8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the rice begins to brown very slightly and the onion becomes soft. It's okay if some grains of rice pop, as this step adds some nuttiness and more depth of flavor to the rice.

Meanwhile, heat 2 1/4 cups of vegetable broth. Mix in 1/2 tbsp tomato paste until it dissolves. Also, defrost 1/2 cup frozen peas.

Add the tomatoes and garlic to the rice and sauté for ~1 min before adding the broth mixture. Bring to a boil, lower the heat to simmer, and cook, covered, for ~15-20 minutes. 

When the rice is fully cooked through, take it off the heat and let it steam with the lid of for another 3-5 min. Then fluff the rice with a fork and mix in the peas. Season with salt to taste.

Artichoke Lemon Pesto,Italian,,,,https://www.ful-filled.com/2020/04/02/artichoke-lemon-pesto/,,Sauce,,,,
Avgolemono (Chicken Orzo Soup),Greek,,,"1 3-pound chicken
1 large carrot, cut into large pieces
1 large leek, white and pale-green parts only, halved
½ medium onion
Kosher salt
2 large eggs
6 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
⅔ cup long-grain white rice (preferably Carolina)
Freshly ground black pepper and olive oil (for serving)
RECIPE PREPARATION
Real Talk: This soup is incredible due to its velvety, luxurious texture. Everyone you serve it to will be impressed. BUT you need to fully reduce the broth to 2 quarts, which should only take a half an hour; you can’t even get through an entire episode of Game of Thrones in that time. So have patience, grasshopper! And you’ll also get to brag to said guests that you learned how to temper eggs (cooking them without scrambling) thanks to this recipe.

Bring chicken, carrot, leek, onion, and 4 quarts water to a simmer in a large pot; cook until chicken is cooked through, 45–60 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate; discard carrot, leek, and onion. Let chicken sit until cool enough to handle.

Continue to cook broth over medium-high heat until reduced to about 2 quarts, about 30 minutes. Season with salt.

Meanwhile, shred meat from thighs and legs; set aside (reserve breasts for another use).

Whisk eggs and lemon juice in a medium bowl until foamy and no streaks remain. Whisking constantly, add 1 cup hot chicken broth, a couple teaspoons at a time at first (don’t pour too much hot broth too quickly or you’ll end up with scrambled eggs), then increasing to a steady stream, until fully incorporated.

Meanwhile, reduce heat to medium and add rice to broth, stirring vigorously so rice doesn’t stick to bottom of pot; cook 5 minutes. Add reserved chicken and continue to cook until chicken is heated through and rice is tender, about 5 minutes more.

Whisking vigorously, slowly drizzle in tempered egg mixture, a couple teaspoons at a time at first, then increasing to a steady stream, until fully incorporated (it will cook instantly).

Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until soup is slightly thickened and velvety and luxurious-looking, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and season with salt. Let sit 10 minutes to thicken up slightly.

Divide soup among bowls; season with pepper and drizzle with oil.

Do Ahead: Soup can be made 3 days ahead; cover and chill.","

Basil Pesto,Italian,,,"2 cups tightly packed fresh basil leaves 
½ cup extra virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons pine nuts 
2 garlic cloves, chopped fine before putting in the processor 
Salt 
½ cup freshly grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese 
2 tablespoons freshly grated pecorino romano cheese
3 tablespoons butter, softened to room temperature
1 ½ pounds pasta

1. Briefly soak and wash the basil in cold water, and gently pat it thoroughly dry with paper towels.
2. Put the basil, olive oil, pine nuts, chopped garlic, and an ample pinch of salt in the processor bowl, and process to a uniform, creamy consistency. 
3. Transfer to a bowl, and mix in the two grated cheeses by hand. It is worth the slight effort to do it by hand to obtain the notably superior texture it produces. When the cheese has been evenly amalgamated with the other ingredients, mix in the softened butter, distributing it uniformly into the sauce. 
4. When spooning the pesto over pasta, dilute it slightly with a tablespoon or two of the hot water in which the pasta was cooked.","Source: ""Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking"" by Marcella Hazan

""Pesto is the sauce the Genoese invented as a vehicle for the fragrance of a basil like no other, their own. Olive oil, garlic, pine nuts, butter, and grated cheese are the only other components. Pesto is never cooked, or heated, and while it may on occasion do good things for vegetable soup, it has just one great role: to be the most seductive of all sauces for pasta... Genoese cooks insist that if it isn’t made in a mortar with a pestle, it isn’t pesto. Linguistically at least, they are correct, because the word comes from the verb pestare, which means to pound or to grind, as in a mortar. They are probably right gastronomically, too...""",,Sauce,,,,

Beef Bolognese (Marcella Hazan),Italian,12,"1 cup parmigiano reggiano,2.5 lb tagliatelle,24 oz San Marzano whole peeled plum tomatoes,2 cups white wine,0.25 tsp nutmeg,2 cups milk,  pepper to taste,  salt to taste,1.5 lb ground beef,6 tbsp butter (unsalted),2 tbsp olive oil,1 cup onion(s),1.33 cup celery,1.33 cup carrot","Prep:
Mince the 1 1/3 cup carrot, 1 1/3 cup celery and 1 cup onion into tiny cubes.

Mash up the 28 oz can of plum tomatoes in their juice with your hands and weigh out 24 oz of it for this recipe.

Directions:
Put 2 tbsp oil, 6 tbsp butter, and the chopped onion into a large pot all at once (i.e. do not melt the butter first). Turn the heat on to medium. Cook and stir the onion until it has become translucent, then add the chopped celery and carrot. Cook for about 2 min, stirring vegetables to coat them well with the butter and oil.

Add 1.5 ground beef (Note: can alternatively use 1 lb beef with 1/2 lb pork), 2 large pinches of salt, and several grindings of black pepper. Using a fork, break the meat up into small crumbles, stir well, and cook until the beef has lost its raw, red color.

Add 2 cups milk and let it simmer gently, stirring frequently, until it has reduced almost all the way. (Note: It should look like there's no liquid in the pot, more like just juicy meat mixture.) This should take ~20-30 minutes.

Add 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 2 cups white wine. Let it simmer, stirring frequently, until it has reduced almost all the way, just like the milk. This should take about another 20-30 minutes.

Add the tomatoes and stir thoroughly to coat all ingredients well. When the tomatoes begin to bubble, turn the heat down very low so that the sauce cooks at the laziest of simmers. Put a diffuser underneath the pot to help reduce the heat even further. 

Cook, uncovered, for 4.5 hours, stirring every 10-15 minutes. While the sauce is cooking, you are likely to find that it begins to dry out and the fat separates from the meat. Spoon the fat off the top if desired, and to keep the sauce from sticking to the pot, add 1/2 cup of water whenever necessary. At the end, the sauce should be thick - not at all watery, but not dried up.

Toss with 2.5 to 3 lb cooked tagliatelle and serve with freshly grated Parmesan on the side.","Marcella Hazan's recipe

Braised Beef Ragú,Italian,8,,"INGREDIENTS:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 – 2 1/2 pounds chuck roast
1 medium onion, chopped finely
6-8 cloves of garlic, pressed
1 cup + 2 tablespoons beef broth
2 tablespoons tomato paste
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 (28 ounce can) crushed tomatoes
1 (14 ounce can) diced tomatoes
2 bay leaves
a few sprigs of fresh thyme
a large bunch of basil (a handful or so, no need to be exact)
1 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon – 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
salt to taste
pappardelle, parsley, and parmesan cheese for serving

DIRECTIONS:
Season both sides of the chuck roast with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a large, dutch oven over medium high heat. Add the beef into the pot and allow it to sear on each side for 5 minutes. Add the onions to the skillet and let them sweat for 4-5 minutes or until they turn translucent. Add the garlic and let cook for another 1-2 minutes.
STOVE TOP: Deglaze the pan with 1 cup of beef broth. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of beef broth to a bowl along with the tomato paste and balsamic vinegar and use a whisk to combine. Add the mixture to the dutch oven and stir to mix. Add the crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, bay leaves, fresh thyme, basil, sugar, and red pepper flakes. Allow the sauce to gain a simmer, stir once. Cover and lower the heat to the lowest setting and let cook for 2 1/2 – 3 1/2 hours or until the meat easily shreds with two forks. Mine took about 3 hours to get the meat to just fall apart. Season with salt to taste. Feel free to skim any excess fat off the top and remove the bay leaves and basil leaves before serving. Serve over pappardelle with a sprinkle of parsley and freshly grated parmesan.
SLOW COOKER: Transfer the meat, onion, and garlic mixture to a slow cooker. Add the 1 cup of beef broth to the slow cooker. Whisk the remaining 2 tablespoons of beef broth in a bowl with the tomato paste and balsamic vinegar. Add the mixture to the slow cooker along with the crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, bay leaves, fresh thyme, basil, sugar, and red pepper flakes. Cover and let cook on the slow setting for 6-8 hours. Use 2 forks to shred the meat. You’ll know it’s done when it falls apart easily. Season with salt to taste. Feel free to skim any excess fat off the top and remove the bay leaves and basil leaves before serving. Serve over pappardelle with a sprinkle of parsley and freshly grated parmesan.","

Prep:
* Roast the squash beforehand. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Cut the squash in half and remove the seeds and strings. Place the squash halves, cut side up, on a rimmed baking sheet. Melt the 1 tbsp butter and brush it over the squash. Sprinkle with salt to taste. Bake until tender (~45 minutes). When cool enough to handle, scrape the flesh out and mash with a large fork. There should be ~ 1 ¾ cups of squash to use.

While the squash is cooling, chop the onion.

Directions:
Place the squash seeds and strings in a sauce pan with the vegetable stock and 1/2 tsp salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer 25-30 minutes. Strain through a fine mesh strainer, extracting as much liquid as possible. Measure the broth and add enough water to make 6 cups.

Heat 1 tbsp butter and the oil in a stockpot over medium heat. When the foaming subsides, add the onion and cook until softened. Add the garlic and sauté for 1 minute. Add the rice and cook for 1 minute. Add the wine and cook till wine is nearly evaporated. Add the broth in 1 cup increment, waiting until one cup is absorbed before adding another. Stir constantly until risotto is creamy NOT soupy. This may not use all the broth because you don’t want it to be soupy.

Remove the pot from the heat and vigorously stir in the squash, cheese, sage, and remaining 1 tbsp butter. Add nutmeg to taste. Serve with more grated cheese.

Cacio e Pepe,Italian,3,"  pepper to taste,4 oz pecorino romano,12 oz pasta,  salt to taste","* Traditionally made in Rome using tonnarelli 

Prep:
Weigh out 12 oz pasta. Measure 4 oz pecorino romano (aka cacio) in a mixing/serving bowl.

Directions:
Bring water to a boil in a large pot and season with salt. In order for cacio e pepe pasta to not be sticky, we have to make sure we drain the pasta when they are VERY al dente. Reserve 1 cup of the pasta water when draining.

Meanwhile, crack some peppercorns with a knife and heat them in a deep pan with a ladle of water from the pasta pot for 3 min.

Add the pasta and 1/2 cup of the pasta water to the pepper broth and cook them together for a little longer.

Meanwhile, mix 1/2 of pasta water with 4 oz. grated cacio to make cacio cream.

Once the pasta is cooked (it still needs to be al dente) we can carefully mix it in the bowl where we’ve prepared the cacio cream.

Top with extra cacio and black pepper to taste and serve immediately.

Prep:
Soften the butter and cream cheese.

Directions:

Split open the vanilla bean and scrape out the seeds.  Put the bean and seeds in a medium but deep saucepan.  Add the sugar.  Cook over high heat, stirring continuously, until the sugar is dissolved. Stir continuously over moderate heat until a medium-light amber caramel forms, about 10 minutes.

Remove from the heat.  Drizzle in the heavy cream 1/4 teaspoon at a time, stirring until well-mixed after each addition. It will both bubble up A LOT when you stir in the cream. If you add all the cold cream immediately, the caramel will harden! 

Stir in 6 oz softened butter until melted.  (Don't worry if the butter separates.)  Discard the vanilla bean.

Immediately transfer the caramel to the large bowl of a mixer and beat with the whisk attachment at low speed until the caramel cools slightly and comes together, about 5 minutes.  With the machine on, beat in the cream cheese, 1 cube at a time and beating well between additions, until silky.

Caramelized Onions,French,,,"Halve both onions through root end. Using the tip of your knife, cut a V-shaped notch around root to remove it (this will ensure that all slices separate when you cut the onion).

Place 1 onion half on your cutting board so root end is facing you, then thinly slice onion lengthwise, starting at one side and working all the way to the other (so your knife runs through the root halfway through, not starting or ending at the root end). You’re going for slices that are ¼""–⅛"" thick.

Repeat same slicing procedure for remaining onion halves. It’s a lot of onion! But it will cook down quite a bit, so it’s best to start with a large quantity.

Heat 2 Tbsp. butter in a large saucepan over medium until melted and sizzling. You can use a skillet to cook the onions, but a pan with high sides will keep the onions from flipping out onto your stove. Using a pan that also has a wide base gives water room to evaporate, allowing the onions to caramelize rather than steam.

Instead of dumping in all of the onions at once, which would fill the pot and make it hard to stir (which would then cause the ones on the bottom to cook faster), start by adding just a couple of large handfuls to the pot. Cook, stirring, until onions are soft and starting to turn translucent, 1–2 minutes. Stir in a few more handfuls of onion and repeat cooking and stirring process until you’ve added all the onions. Season with a pinch of salt.

Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook onions, stirring every few minutes to prevent them from sticking and coloring too much in any one place, until blonde-colored, 15–20 minutes. This is the point of doneness for French onion soup! If you feel like onions are getting too brown around the edges or they’re sticking, reduce your heat a bit.

If you’re going for onions that are both softer and more caramelized (say for a patty melt or onion dip), keep cooking, stirring regularly, until onions are unmistakably golden brown, another 15–20 minutes. Because most of the water has cooked off at this point, there might be some bare spots where the pot could start to burn. If this happens, stir in a splash of broth or water. The liquid will dissolve the cooked-on bits, which the onions will re-absorb.

For extra-dark onions, the kind that make a great burger topping, cook until they start to almost blacken around the edges and go slightly crisp, another 10–15 minutes. This requires constant attention so they don’t burn!

Let onions cool in the saucepan, then use or transfer to an airtight container and chill. They will keep up to 1 week.",,Vegetarian,,,"BAP_Basically_Carmelized-Onions_STEP_06.mp4.mp4 (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/ea806846c03fca434d85125dd27661e4/9744a03f/BAP_Basically_Carmelized-Onions_STEP_06.mp4.mp4),BAP_Basically_Carmelized-Onions_STEP_07.mp4.mp4 (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/bd13b9f85ccb7991716e31bf813ffee9/034615f7/BAP_Basically_Carmelized-Onions_STEP_07.mp4.mp4),BAP_Basically_Carmelized-Onions_STEP_08.mp4.mp4 (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/45d4d2073cc7441ad5e908d576e23508/dfd86f8c/BAP_Basically_Carmelized-Onions_STEP_08.mp4.mp4)",,

Cheesecake,Greek,12,"3 cups sour cream,0.25 tsp salt,1.5 tsp vanilla extract,2 tbsp lemon juice,3  egg(s),1 tbsp cornstarch,1 cup sugar,16 oz cream cheese,6 tbsp butter (unsalted),4 tbsp Dutch-processed cocoa powder,3 tbsp sugar,3 tbsp light brown sugar,1.25 cups Nabisco chocolate wafers","* Requires overnight preparation

Prep:
Cover the outside bottom and sides of a 9 x 2 1/2-inch spring-form pan with a double thickness of aluminum foil.  Grease the pan with butter or cooking spray. Line the bottom with a round of waxed paper; grease the waxed paper. Take out a second pan large enough to fit the first one in.

In the food processor, grind ~30 Nabisco chocolate wafers. Measure out 1 ¼ cups of the crumbs, and add that amount back into the food processor. (Save any leftover crumbs for sprinkling on top of the cheesecake if desired.) Mix in 3 tbsp sugar, 3 tbsp brown sugar, and 4 tbsp cocoa powder. Next, add 6 tbsp MELTED butter and pulse until the mixture forms coarse crumbs. 

Press the dough into an even layer over the bottom of the prepared pan. Refrigerate until the cheesecake batter is ready.

Fill a teapot with water and turn on the heat.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Directions:
In a large mixer bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until smooth.  Slowly beat in the 1 cup sugar. Then cream the cheese and sugar for 7 - 10 minutes until smooth and silky. Make sure to scrape the very bottom of the bowl so that any cream cheese stuck to the bottom does not come out unmixed later on. 

Next, beat in the cornstarch.  One at a time, add the 3 eggs, beating after each addition.  Mix in the 2 tbsp lemon juice, 1.5 tsp vanilla, and 1/4 tsp salt. Put the sour cream in a medium bowl and whisk it by hand until smooth.  Also by hand, gently fold it into the batter.

Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Place the spring-form pan in the larger pan, and put them in the oven.  Carefully fill the larger pan with boiling water from the teapot, until it reaches about halfway up the sides of the spring-form pan. Bake for 55-60 minutes.

LEAVING THE OVEN DOOR CLOSED, turn off the oven and leave the cheesecake inside for 1 hour.  Remove from the oven and take it out of the pan of water.  Remove the aluminum foil wrap. Put on a rack and let the cheesecake cool at room temperature for 3 hours. Cover with plastic wrap and **refrigerate overnight.**

4. Roast
5. Rest

BRINE
Before you begin brining you need to figure out how much liquid you will need to fully submerge the protein. This will allow you to calculate the amount of salt and sugar needed. To do this, simply place the protein into the container and, using a measuring cup, calculate the amount of liquid it takes to completely submerge your protein. 

Now that you have that info, you can figure the proper salt and sugar ratios. If using kosher salt, add ¼ cup per quart of liquid. If using table salt, add 2 tablespoons per quart.  **Take the protein out of the water before adding the salt.**

If you are using pieces of protein, the average weight of the pieces (not the total weight) is used to calculate the brining time. Example: 3 one-pound pieces of protein = 1 hour of brining (not 3 hours). **The exception to this rule is pieces weighing 8 ounces or less; those should brine for no more than 30 minutes.**

1) Mix together liquid, salt, and sugar (if using) until salt and sugar are fully dissolved.
2) Add the protein to the brine, making sure that it is fully submerged.
3) Leave the protein in the brine for an hour per pound. Store in the refrigerator, as the brine must be kept cold at all times during the process.

BRUSH
If you're breading the chicken or putting on a specific marinade, ignore the next two steps. If not, brush the chicken with olive oil or butter now.

RUB
Rub desired spices onto the chicken.

ROAST
Roast the chicken breasts for 12-18 minutes at 450°F, depending on their thickness. Stick a meat thermometer into the thickest part of each chicken breast. When the internal temperature of each reaches 165°F, it's fully cooked.

REST
Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes before cutting into it.","https://www.savoryspiceshop.com/blog/brining-101-brining-tips-tricks

PART 1 - Spice Reduction
Measure out a 1-inch piece of fresh ginger and peel it. Place it into a small pot with 12 oz water. Add 6 sticks of cinnamon, 6 whole cloves, and 4 anise stars to the pot. 

Boil these ingredients for 10 min with the lid on at a medium high temperature and then drop to a medium temperature for 10 more minutes.

When the water turns a caramel color, pull the pot off the heat and set it aside to cool. In Part 2, you'll mix this reduction with the rest of the ingredients.

Preheat the oven to 375. Wash the potatoes, poke holes in them all over with a fork, and rub them with some kosher salt. Place a wire rack on top of a baking sheet and place the potatoes on top. Bake them for 60-75 minutes, turning at the halfway mark.  

To ensure they're fully cooked in the middle, poke them with a fork. If you encounter any resistance, they're not soft enough in the middle yet, so keep baking them.

When the finished potatoes have cooled enough to touch, remove their skin and dice them. Let the diced potatoes dry out to ensure maximum crispiness.

Meanwhile, chop the corned beef finely and dice the onion. 

Directions:
Pre-cook the corned beef until it's crispy and set it aside. Fry the onions and potatoes over medium heat until they start to brown. 

Meanwhile, in a small mixing bowl, combine 1 tbsp slightly crushed mustard seeds, 1 tbsp parsley, and 1 tsp sage.

When the potatoes and onions are ready, add back the corned beef along with seasoning mixture and 2-3 tbsp butter. Then add salt, fresh cracked black pepper, and a sprinkle of garlic powder to taste. Fry this mixture until crispy. 

If serving the hash with eggs, add them in one of these two ways:
1. Fry or poach a few eggs in a separate pan and serve them alongside your hash.

Using a mixer and its whisk attachment, pour in 1 cup milk with 3/4 cup sifted flour. 
1. Put the milk in a bowl and add the flour gradually, sifting it through a sieve if possible, while you mix steadily with a fork or whisk to avoid making lumps. When you have added all the flour, beat the mixture until it is evenly blended. 

2. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating them in rapidly with a fork. When both eggs have been incorporated into the batter, add the salt, stirring to distribute it. 

3. Lightly smear the bottom of the skillet with some of the butter. Turn on the heat under the pan to medium low.

4. Give the batter a good stirring, and pour 2 tablespoons of it into the pan. Tilt and rotate the pan to distribute the batter evenly. 

5. As soon as the batter sets and becomes firm and speckled brown, slip a spatula underneath it and flip it over to cook the other side. Stack the finished crespelle on a plate. 

6. Coat the bottom of the skillet with a tiny amount of butter, and repeat the procedure described above until you’ve used up all the batter. Remember to stir the batter each time before pouring it into the pan.

Galette des Rois (NYT Cooking),French,,,"INGREDIENTS
FOR THE FILLING:
6 tablespoons (85 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature
¾ cup (85 grams) confectioners’ sugar
¾ cup (85 grams) almond flour
¼ teaspoon salt
2 large eggs, at room temperature
1 tablespoon rum (optional)
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
TO ASSEMBLE:
2 9 1/2-inch-diameter circles puff-pastry dough (from a 14- to 17-ounce package; 396-482 grams), cold
1 whole almond or dried bean, for the charm

PREPARATION
TO MAKE THE FILLING:
Working with a mixer or by hand, beat the butter and sugar together until creamy and light. Beat in the almond flour and the salt. Mix in 1 whole egg, then the white from the second egg (reserve the yolk). Mix in the rum, if using, and the extract. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
Mix the yolk with 1 teaspoon cold water; cover, and refrigerate until needed.
TO ASSEMBLE:
Place one circle of dough on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Spread the filling evenly over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border bare. Press the charm into the filling. Moisten the border with cold water, position the second circle of dough over the filling and press around the border with your fingertips to seal well. Using the back of a table knife, scallop the edges by pushing into the dough (about 1/4- to 1/2-inch deep) every 1/2 inch or so. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
Heat the oven to 425. Brush a thin layer of the reserved yolk glaze over the top of the galette, avoiding the border (if glaze drips down the rim, the galette won’t rise). With the point of a paring knife, etch a design into the top of the galette, taking care not to pierce the dough. Cut 6 small slits in the top as steam vents.
Turn the heat down to 400, and bake for 30 to 40 minutes, until the galette is puffed and deeply golden. Check after 20 minutes, and tent loosely with foil if it’s browning too much or too fast. Transfer to a rack, and cool for at least 15 minutes (the galette may deflate — that’s puff pastry for you). Serve warm or at room temperature.",NYT Cooking: https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019114-galette-des-rois,,,,24mag-24ondessert-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/51b7c9edc98307e68df423857aad1898/ebe7fd6d/24mag-24ondessert-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg),,

Gianduja Cheesecake,Italian,12,,"Cookie Crust
30 chocolate sandwich cookies (Oreos are good)
1 cup hazelnuts
3 tbsp sugar
6 tbsp butter, melted

Cheesecake
10 ounces 72% dark chocolate, chopped
24 ounces cream cheese
3/4 cup FAGE Total Greek Yogurt 2%
3 large eggs
1 large egg yolk
1 1/4 cups sugar
1/4 cup Dutch cocoa powder

Chocolate Hazelnut Ganache:
4 ounces (1/2 cup) Nutella
4 ounces (1/2 cup) heavy cream
2 ounces 72% dark chocolate, chopped
1/4 cup toasted hazelnuts, chopped

* Requires overnight preparation

Prep:
Cover the outside bottom and sides of a 9 x 2 1/2-inch spring-form pan with a double thickness of aluminum foil.  Grease the pan with butter or cooking spray. Line the bottom with a round of waxed paper; grease the waxed paper. Take out a second pan large enough to fit the first one in.

Preheat the oven to 350F for pre-baking the crust. Take out the 24 oz. cream cheese to soften.

Directions:
CRUST
Place ~30 Nabisco chocolate wafers and 1 cup blanched hazelnuts in the food processor and pulse until finely ground. Mix in 3 tbsp sugar. Then, add 6 tbsp MELTED butter and pulse until the mixture forms coarse crumbs, resembling wet sand.

Scrape into prepared pan and use fingers to press into the bottom and up the side of the pan, making sure the crust is even. Bake in oven for 8 minutes. Place on wire rack to cool. Keep oven temperature.

CHEESECAKE FILLING
Prepare cheesecake filling by placing 10 oz. of chopped chocolate in a double boiler until smooth and creamy. Remove from heat and let cool for a few minutes.

Set a pot of water to boil on the stove while the filling is made. 

In an electric or stand mixer, beat 24 oz. cream cheese and 3/4 cup plain 2% greek yogurt until smooth and fluffy. Add in 1 1/4 cups sugar and 1/4 cup Dutch cocoa powder and beat again until smooth. Then add in 3 eggs and 1 egg yolk, blending until there is a silky consistency. Fold in melted chocolate until thoroughly combined.

Pour chocolate cheesecake filling over the cooled crust and smooth the top with a spatula. Tap a few times to release any air in the batter. Place the spring-form pan in the larger pan, and put them in the oven. Carefully fill the larger pan with boiling water from the teapot, until it reaches about halfway up the sides of the spring-form pan. 

Bake for 55-60 minutes, or until the center no longer jiggles. Cool the cheesecake 10 minutes, then run a knife around the crust to loosen it. Chill the cheesecake a minimum of 4 hours in fridge, although overnight is best.

GANACHE
In a medium saucepan, heat 1/2 cup heavy cream over low heat to avoid curdling. Add 1/2 cup of Nutella and stir until smooth. Add in 2 ounces of chopped dark chocolate and stir until melted. Pour or drizzle over the center of the chocolate cheesecake and spread to outer edges to help cover any cracks. If desired, top with toasted hazelnuts.

Serve while ganache is warm or place in refrigerator to cool. Cut into 12-16 slices and enjoy!

Prep:
Get out all the ingredients for the sauce. Place aluminum foil on two baking sheets and spray with olive oil. Mix some flour, salt, and pepper on a wide plate.

Without turning on the stovetop, crush 6 cloves garlic into a small saucepan. Pour in 3/4 cup honey, 6 tbsp soy sauce, 1.5 tbsp ginger paste, 3/4 tsp chili flakes, and 1/4 cup water. Set aside for later.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Meanwhile, dab each chicken wing with paper towels until completely dry. Then coat each one with the flour mixture, shaking off any excess. Once laid out on the baking sheets, spray the wings with olive oil. 

Bake the chicken wings for ~40 min or until they are golden brown and crispy. Turn the wings every 10 min to ensure even browning.

When the chicken has been in for 20 min, start heating the sauce. Bring it to a boil, reduce heat and simmer about 3 min.  Mix 1.5 tsp cornstarch with 1/4 cup cold water, then stir that into the sauce. Let it simmer for ~10 minutes or until thickened, stirring occasionally.

Spray a baking dish with olive oil. Place the chicken wings into the dish and toss with sauce to coat them. Put the baking dish in the oven for ~10 minutes, turning the wings after 5 minutes.

Finally, allow the wings to cool ~10 minutes. As the sauce cools, it thickens, so stir the wings every few minutes to ensure it sticks to the wings in an even coating.

1 ½ tsp ground cumin 
1 teaspoon ground coriander 
1 teaspoon brown mustard seeds 
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
½ teaspoon fennel seeds -- EXCLUDE these
½ tsp GROUND fenugreek seeds********
Generous pinch of cayenne pepper -- add more... maybe 1/2 tsp
2 large garlic cloves, crushed -- do not use paste
2 tsp ginger paste (finely chopped peeled fresh ginger)
5.5 cups water
2 fresh bay leaves
Pinch of kosher salt, plus more to taste
Whole-milk yogurt and fresh cilantro leaves, for serving  

Directions:
Step 1
Place mung beans and rice in a fine wire-mesh strainer; rinse under cold water, stirring with your hands, until water runs clear, about 3 minutes. 

Step 2
Place cinnamon stick, whole cloves, cumin, coriander, mustard seeds, turmeric, fennel seeds, fenugreek, and cayenne in a large heavy-bottomed pot or a medium Dutch oven. Heat over medium, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until very fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and ginger; cook, stirring constantly, 1 minute. Add mung bean mixture; stir to coat in spices. Add 6 1/2 cups water, bay leaves, and salt. 

Step 3
Bring mixture to a vigorous simmer over medium-high, stirring occasionally. 

Cover and reduce heat to low; simmer, stirring and running spoon along bottom of pot occasionally, until mung bean mixture is tender but rice still holds it shape, 12 to 15 minutes. (Mixture will be slightly runny, but it will thicken as it sits.) Remove from heat. Remove and discard cinnamon, whole cloves, and bay leaves. Gently stir in salt to taste. Divide evenly among bowls; dollop with yogurt, and sprinkle with cilantro.","Source: https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/khichdi

Peel the eggplant so that it has stripes of skin. Slice it into medium-thin pieces. Place the slices onto a baking sheet and salt the top sides. Set the timer for 15 minutes, and let them sit.
 
Meanwhile, grate the graviera (or gruyere if substituting). When the timer goes off, flip the eggplant slices, salt them, and set the timer for another 15 minutes. 

At this point, set the oven to preheat to 350 degrees F. Mince the onion while the eggplant sits for its second round.
 
Directions:
Heat some olive oil in a large, deep skillet and toss in the onions with the bay leaves and the cinnamon stick. Let these caramelize on very low heat for 15 minutes.

2 cups (or more) low-salt chicken broth
1 pound paccheri (giant rigatoni) or regular rigatoni
1 cup heavy whipping cream
2 tbsp lemon juice

Prep: 
Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Fry in a deep skillet over medium heat until golden, ~5 minutes per side.

Meanwhile, chop 2 cups onion and peel and crush 6 cloves garlic. Also, crush 1 tsp saffron with a mortar and pestle.

Directions: 
Transfer chicken to plate, and sauté the onions and garlic in the drippings until onions are slightly softened, 7 to 8 minutes.

At this point, add 2 cups white wine and the 1 tsp of crushed saffron. Bring to a boil and let it continue to boil until the liquid has thickened and reduced by less than half, ~8 minutes.

Move the skillet to the smallest burner. Add 2 cups chicken broth, and return the chicken to the skillet. Bring to a boil, then cover and let it simmer on very low heat for ~1 hour. Adjust the heat as needed to prevent boiling and turn the chicken over after 30 min.

After this, transfer the chicken to a plate to cool. Then, tear chicken into bite-size pieces and set aside. 

At this point, boil salted water for 1 lb pasta and cook it until al dente. When it's done, drain it and set it aside.

Meanwhile, add 1 cup heavy cream to the sauce in the original skillet and let it boil for ~10 min to reduce it. If needed add some cornstarch and water. It's done when it's ALMOST thick enough to coat a spoon. 

While the sauce reduces, you can julienne 2/3 cup of fresh basil.

Stir in 2 tablespoons lemon juice, then chicken pieces. Finally, mix in the pasta. Stir over medium heat until heated through, ~5 min. Add more broth in 2 oz portions to thin the sauce as needed and add more lemon juice by teaspoonful to taste, if desired.

Pan-Seared Steak Au Poivre,French,,,"1) Place the meat on a rack and let it come to room temperature about 30 min to 1 hr before cooking, depending on the thickness of the cut.

2) Pat the steak dry meat before seasoning it because dry meat forms the best crust.

3) Preheat the pan to a high temperature. Ideally, use a cast-iron pan because it heats more evenly, ensuring the steak cooks evenly.

4) Season generously with Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper *immediately before* cooking. If you season it too early, the salt draws moisture out of the meat. 

5) Add a little bit of oil to the pan. As soon as the oil starts to smoke, that's when you should add the steak to the pan.

6) Cook the steak 3-5 min on each side until a brown crust forms. 
-- Flip multiple times: https://www.seriouseats.com/2012/12/the-food-lab-complete-guide-to-pan-seared-steaks.html#oil
-- Don't turn the steak and flip it only once. This lets the Maillard reaction create that signature taste on seared steak. https://www.foodandwine.com/how/grilling-mistakes-avoid-according-chefs

7) Cooking the steak to 5-10 degrees below the desired temp and then... 
-- Rare: 120-130°F
-- Medium rare: 130-135°F
-- Medium: 140-145°F
-- Medium Well: 150-155°F
-- Well: 160-165°F

8) Make sure to let the steak rest in a warm place after removing it from the pan. It will keep cooking slightly. Resting the steak allows the collagen in the meat to thicken the juices as it cools, creating a juicier steak.

INSTRUCTIONS
MARINADE: 
Add all ingredients except chicken in a small bowl. Whisk to combine.

Place chicken in a container and thoroughly coat it with the marinade. Refrigerate for 2 to 6 hours. **Do not marinate longer than 8 hours or the chicken will get tough and begin to break down.**

Prepare the grill: Preheat grill to medium heat (350°F-375°F) for indirect cooking. This means light the burners (or charcoal) on one half of the grill, and leave them off on the other half. This creates a zone of direct heat and a zone of indirect heat. Grease the preheated grill grates to prevent sticking by wiping them down with a folded paper towel that's been soaked in vegetable oil.

Grill: Remove the chicken from the marinade and shake off any excess liquid. Grill chicken skin side down over direct heat for about 8 to 10 minutes with the lid closed as much as possible, until the skin is crispy and golden. Flip chicken over, move to indirect heat and grill for 15 to 20 minutes, until the meat is firm and the temperature registers 165°F.","Source: https://www.isabeleats.com/pollo-asado/#wprm-recipe-container-14347

Notes: 
- Don’t have achiote powder? You can leave it out completely or substitute regular paprika in its place. It won’t quite have the same flavor, but it will still be delicious!
- To make in the oven – Marinate chicken according to instructions above. Remove chicken from marinade and shake off any excess liquid. Place chicken on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or foil and bake in a 400°F oven for 30-40 minutes depending on the thickness of the chicken. The internal temperature should read at least 165°F on an instant-read thermometer.
- To make in the slow cooker – Add all ingredients into a large slow cooker. Add 1/2 cup chicken broth or water, mix together to coat the chicken and cover. Cook on low for 6-7 hours or on high for about 3 hours.","Halal,Paleo",Entree,,,,

Raspberry Macarons with Chocolate Ganache Filling,French,,,,"Ingredients

For the Meringue
200 grams confectioners' sugar
110 grams almonds
100 grams egg whites 
35 grams of granulated sugar
1 tsp raspberry extract
Pink food coloring gel/liquid
 
For the Ganache
6 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped
1/3 cup heavy cream
2 tsp raspberry extract
 




Directions
For the Meringue
Line two large baking sheets with coated parchment paper.  In the bowl of a food processor, process the almonds and confectioners' sugar together until finely ground, about 2-3 minutes.  If using powdered food coloring, add it at this time; set aside.
 
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the whites and salt on medium speed until foamy.  With the motor running, gradually add the granulated sugar, then increase speed to high and continue to beat until the whites hold soft, glossy peaks.  If using gel food coloring, fold it in at this time.  Using a runner spatula, fold in the almond mixture until it is thick and sticky.  When it is ready, the batter should drop from the spatula in a smooth molten mass. This will take about 1 minute or 50 strokes.
 
Spoon the batter into a pastry bag fitted with a large round tip (Ateco #808), pressing out excess air.  Twist the bag firmly just above the batter, then pipe 1 1/2-inch diameter rounds onto the prepared sheets, about 24 per sheet.  Tap the bottom of the baking sheets sharply, once, on the work surface to release any large air bubbles. Let the cookies stand, uncovered, at room temperature until the tops are no longer sticky and a light crust has formed, at least 30 minutes and up to an hour.
 
Meanwhile, start making the filling so that it cools in time.  Also, preheat the oven to 295° F. Bake the cookies until the tops are crisp and the bottoms dry, about 16 minutes.  Cool completely on racks.
 
For the Ganache
Chop the chocolate finely.  Add the chocolate and butter to a medium bowl.  In a small saucepan, heat the cream just until it comes to a simmer.  Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and let rest for five minutes.  Stir the chocolate until the mixture is smooth.  Stir in the raspberry extract.  Let stand at room temperature until cooled completely and thickened. 
 
To Assemble the Macarons
Carefully flip the cookies over on the baking sheets (they will be fragile) and partner them up in size.  Fill a pastry bag fitted with a round tip with the ganache and pipe or spoon kisses of ganache onto half of the cookie bottoms.  Sandwich the cookie halves together.  Enjoy immediately, or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week or in the freezer for up to one month.  Bon appétit!

1/2 tsp vanilla extract, optional
1 tsp kahlua, optional

Prep: 
Weight out 4 oz. chocolate chips.

Directions:
For the base...
In a medium saucepan, mix 3/4 cup sugar, 2 tbsp cornstarch, and 1/2 cup cocoa powder. Then whisk in 1.25 cups of the milk and 3/4 cup cream.

Set over medium heat and bring to a boil while whisking constantly. Use a spatula and whisk alternately. The whisk doesn't scrape the chocolate off the bottom of the pan. As such, it will create a layer of burnt chocolate if you don't move the chocolate touching the bottom around throughout the process. Use the spatula for scraping the bottom and sides.

When it boils, add 1/2 tsp vanilla extract if desired. Then lower the heat to the minimum and simmer for about 4 min or until the mixture is thick and creamy.

Remove from the heat and mix in the chocolate chips until they're completely melted. Use a whisk to help remove lumps. Next, mix in the coffee liqueur, if using, and finally, whisk in the remaining milk. Uncovered, let cool to room temperature, then chill in the refrigerator for AT LEAST 6 hours.

Churning the gelato...
Strain the gelato base through a fine mesh strainer to help ensure a silky smooth texture. Pour into the bowl of the gelato machine and follow the manufacturer directions.* Stop the machine when the gelato is icy but still soft.

Transfer the gelato to an airtight container and freeze until firm, about two hours. The gelato will keep, frozen, for up to two weeks. Always take the gelato out to room temperature 10 to 15 minutes before serving to soften it and make it easier to scoop.

Sauté the onion in 2 tbsp olive over medium heat until translucent. Add the rice and stir with a wooden spoon until the rice is well coated. Add 6 oz. white wine to the rice.

Next, add a ladle of broth, stirring until it's absorbed.  Make sure to wipe the sides and bottom of the pot clean as you stir so that the risotto doesn't stick and burn. Repeat this with 2 more ladles of broth, then add 1.5 tbsp saffron threads.

Keep adding ladles of broth until the risotto is NEARLY cooked. It will keep cooking as it cools down. If making arancini, you want it to absorb any extra moisture so that it's easy to shape into balls later.

Finely chop 2 tbsp fresh flat-leaf parsley, 2 tbsp fresh mint, and 3 cloves garlic. Combine in a small bowl. Add 1-2 tbsp olive oil and season with salt and pepper to taste.

Fill a medium-size bowl with water and some lemon juice to prevent the artichokes from oxidizing when you prep them.

Rinse each artichoke and pull off its rough outer leaves. Cut the stem, leaving only a small piece. With a paring knife, remove the hard dark green leaf remnants around the base, trimming the area into a rounded shape. Cut off the upper tip of each artichoke so that the top is flat and even. Also, peel the rougher bits of the stems you removed so you can add them to the pan later.

Directions: 
Gently open each artichoke, and use a knife and/or a small spoon to remove all of the central downy heart (i.e. the ""choke""). Fill the interior of each with the herb mixture and rub some of it on the outside of each one.

In a narrow saucepan, place the artichokes VERY tightly together to prevent them from opening during cooking. **They should be standing face-down, stem-up.** Pour over the remaining olive oil, then add 1/2 cup water.

Slice each of the 3 medium eggplants in half. Using a spoon, scoop the flesh out, leaving a 1/4-inch-thick shell. Chop the scooped out eggplant flesh and add it to the colander. Toss the chopped eggplant with 2 tbsp of kosher salt and let drain for 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Set a wire rack on a baking sheet. Add the 6 eggplant shells to the pot and cook, gently poking them under to keep them submerged, until just tender, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the eggplant shells to the wire rack to drain and cool.

Chop the onion and crush the bay leaves into a powder while the chopped eggplant is being salted and the shells are cooling.

Rinse the salt off the chopped eggplant thoroughly and squeeze out as much of the water as possible. This should yield about 4 cups of chopped eggplant. 

Directions: 
Lightly oil a 9-by-13-inch baking dish and arrange the eggplant shells in it, cut sides up.

In a large, deep skillet, heat 3 tbsp of olive oil until shimmering. Add the onion and bay leaf powder and cook over moderate heat until the onion is softened, about 5 minutes.

In a medium saucepan, 1.25 cups of the milk and 3/4 cup cream. Then add the split vanilla bean or 1 tbsp vanilla extract. Warm over low-medium heat until it just starts to bubble around the edge (no need to bring it to a boil), especially because you don't want it to curdle.

Place the egg yolk in a medium bowl and whisk until pale and thickened, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Temper the egg yolk by slowly pouring one ladleful of the hot milk mixture into the yolk, whisking constantly, then slowly pour the egg yolk mixture back into the saucepan, whisking to combine.

Remove from the heat. Uncovered, let cool to room temperature, then chill in the refrigerator for AT LEAST 6 hours.

If using a vanilla bean, fish it out of the custard. (You can rinse the used vanilla bean under cold water, pat it dry, then add it to a jar of brown sugar to keep it moist and infuse some of the vanilla flavor into it.)

Mince 3 small shallots and crush 3 cloves garlic.

Slice the chicken breasts in half crosswise to make them thinner.

Directions:
In a deep skillet, heat some olive oil and cook the chicken for 3-5 minutes on each side until both sides are golden brown. Once each piece reaches 165ºF internally, remove it to a plate and set aside.

Next, sauté the shallots and garlic in a little olive oil until they have softened and turned slightly golden. Add 2/3 cup white wine to deglaze the pan and let it simmer for a few minutes until it has reduced slightly. Use a wooden spoon to stir the mixture and to lift any caramelized bits from the pan.

Meanwhile, mix 1/2 cup chicken stock, 1/2 cup crème fraîche, and 1 tsp dried tarragon. Add this mixture to the skillet and let the sauce simmer gently for a few minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

In a small bowl, mix 1 tbsp cornstarch and 1 tbsp water. Drizzle this slurry into the sauce while stirring the sauce constantly to avoid creating lumps. Let the sauce simmer for 1-2 minutes until it has thickened.
